# PHP Backend API Project

This is a simple PHP backend project built without any framework.  
It includes basic REST API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to demonstrate how a server works locally and online.  
The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to connect to the API hosted at the same domain.

Features:
- Simple PHP backend with JSON responses
- Basic CRUD operations
- CORS enabled for frontend requests
- Example frontend using Fetch API
